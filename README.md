# Cats vs. Dogs Classification using Pre-trained CNN

Welcome to the **Cats vs. Dogs Classification** project! 🐱🐶

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between these two categories using transfer learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

- **Model**: Pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16/ResNet50)
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Language**: Python
- **Objective**: Classify images as either "cat" or "dog" with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bilalahmed6913/Cats-vs-Dogs-CNN.git
   cd Cats-vs-Dogs-CNN
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Note**: If `requirements.txt` is missing, install packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
   ```

### 📊 Dataset

- Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) and extract it.
- Place the dataset in the `dataset/` directory or update the path in the Jupyter Notebook.

## 📓 Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `catvsdog pretrained model.ipynb` and run all the cells sequentially.

### 🖼️ How to Use

To use the model for your own predictions:
1. Add your image in the designated directory.
2. Modify the code in the **prediction section** of the notebook to point to your image file.
3. Run the notebook cell to classify the image as either "Cat" or "Dog."

## 🛠️ Model Architecture

- The pre-trained model used in this project (e.g., VGG16) was fine-tuned for binary classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: The last few layers of the pre-trained model were replaced to adapt to the Cats vs. Dogs classification task.
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of `0.0001`.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy.

## 📈 Results

- Achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set.
- The model performs well in classifying both cats and dogs with minimal overfitting.

## ⚠️ Potential Issues

If you encounter the error:
```
ValueError: Invalid input shape for input Tensor
```
Make sure to resize the input images to `(150, 150, 3)` before passing them to the model. Check the preprocessing section in the notebook for details.
